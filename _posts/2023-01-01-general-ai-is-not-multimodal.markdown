A lot of definitions of AGI confuse the concept with multimodal AI. One example is Yann LeCun who asserts that humans are specialized and so AI will also be specialized. [1]

- Humans are not able to deal with all modalities of data, for example, we canâ€™t do protein folding. Yet Humanity is able to come up with solutions for protein folding.
- A sufficiently strong coding AI could similarly come up with solutions for new modalities of data.

<!-- Another strong piece of evidence is just how easy transformers like GATO can deal with all sorts of data, as long as it is chunked in some form of token. Weather the tokens represent vision, action or text does not matter all that much. -->
