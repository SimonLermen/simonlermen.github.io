A lot of definitions of AGI confuse the concept with multimodal AI. One example is Yann LeCun who asserts that humans are specialized and so AI will also always be specialized. [1]

- Humans are not able to deal with all modalities of data, for example, we canâ€™t do protein folding. Yet Humanity is able to come up with solutions for protein folding.
- A sufficiently strong coding AI could similarly come up with solutions for new modalities of data.
