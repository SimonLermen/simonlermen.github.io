- ASI likely to be centralized for multiple reasons
  - requires huge resources to start
  - will be very hard to catch up to the first one
- useful brain-computer interfaces and brain uploads won't be developed before ASI
- No point in adding human brains after ASI was created
- getting anywhere close to enough hardware to turn 8 billion people into ASI is a strange use of resources.
- biological constraints are the reason why there isn't only a single actor in the world right now

What would it take for transhumanism to actually make a difference in any way?

Even if that would work, would it bring us closer to a solution of ai alignment?

Does it functionally differ from wireheading?

Few people take transhumanism seriously but these are just my thoughts on why it is probably not a direction worth hoping for.
